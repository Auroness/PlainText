  "name": "wanderer",
  "description": "The wanderer is an individualistic character. Because he likes to go out into the world on his own, he is more adept at discovering its secrets. He has good fighting skills, but not such great defense. He makes up for his weak defense by being fast and agile though. His magic skills are slightly above average. As a special skill, he is able to wield two weapons at once.",

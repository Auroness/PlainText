  DESIGN

The source code is split into two main directories:

 - engine    ) Contains all the sources for the core game engine.
 - interface ) Contains interfaces for interacting with the engine.


The engine uses four threads:

 - main thread ) This is running the main Qt event loop where all events from
                 the interfaces and timers initially enter. Every action that
                 needs to be done on the game data is posted as an event on the
                 game thread.
 - game thread ) The game thread processes events that manipulate the core game
                 data. Any generated output is passed back through Qt signals
                 back to the interfaces. When an object is modified, an event
                 is posted to the sync thread for synchronizing the changes to
                 disk.
 - sync thread ) The sync thread writes modified objects back to disk.
 - log thread )  The log thread writes all log messages (including statistics)
                 to disk. In addition, when statistics are requested through
                 the admin interface, it is used for aggregating the results.

Note: It is important to note that all game objects are assigned to the main
      thread even though all manipulation (after the initial loading) is done
      by the game thread.
